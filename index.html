        Born JoAnne Deborah Byron in New York, Assata Shakur is an activist and a former member of the Black Liberation Army & the Black Panthers. Her parents divorced when she was a baby. For 3 years, she grew up with her mother, her aunt Evelyn, and grandparents in Jamaica, Queens. At the age of three, Shakur moved to North Carolina with grandparents. It was here where Shakur experienced racism and internalized self-hatred in the Jim Crow segregated South. “I can remember clearly squatting in the bushes with mosquitoes biting my bare buttocks, and my grandmother handing me toilet paper, because we could not find a place with a ‘colored’ bathroom. Sometimes we were hungry, but there was no place to eat. Other times we were sleepy and there was no hotel or motel that would admit us. If I sit and add up all the ‘colored’ toilets and drinking fountains in my life and all of the back-of-the-buses or the Jim Crow railway cars or the places I couldn't go, it adds up to one great ball of anger” (Shakur Chapter 8).

        As a teenager, Shakur returns to NYC to live with her mother and stepfather. She faced microaggressions and macroaggressions which only fueled her growing passion for civil rights and Black empowerment. Shakur went to BMCC and CCNY where she became more active in her political and social activism. It was her college years that had mobilized her. “Of all the things I had wanted to be when I was a little girl, a revolutionary certainly wasn’t one of them. And now it was the only thing I wanted to do. Everything else was secondary” (Shakur Chapter 13).

        After graduating, she moved to California and joined the Black Panther Party. She returned to NYC to lead the Harlem Chapter of the Black Panther Party but had ultimately left because of differing views and instead joined the Black liberation movement. The Black Liberation Army, being a militant group, was known to actively protest against the US government using guerilla-like tactics. As a result, the group was under constant investigation and interference from government officials. This targeting led to the arrest of Shakur where she faced multiple charges including bank robbery and the murder of a police officer. During her incarceration, she faces police brutality and other challenges while also being pregnant. She did not receive access to proper medical care and was isolated from other inmates. “At first, they wouldn’t even give me milk. Since pork was served as a staple meat almost daily, I began to slowly starve. (In county jails it goes like this: one sheet, one horse blanket, a metal cup; your cell is raided if you have luxuries, like salt.) They did everything they could to thwart the care Dr. Garrett was trying to give me” (Shakur Chapter 9).

        She eventually gave birth to her daughter, Kakuya Shakur. Shakur was ultimately acquitted of the kidnapping charge but remained incarcerated. So in 1979, with the help of other members of the BLA, Shakur escaped from prison and left the country.

        Now, Shakur lives in a political asylum in Cuba, where she continues to write about her experiences.

              Hi, I’m a senior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science.
              Creating this website for my final project has been an incredibly rewarding experience. 
              Not only did I enjoy the process of building and designing it, but I also learned so much about 
              the critical topics of mass incarceration and police violence. This project allowed me to combine my 
              passion for technology with raising awareness about important social justice issues. Thank you for visiting, 
              and I hope you find this website as meaningful as I found its creation!

                Hello! I'm a Junior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science.
                Combining my passions for social justice and technology, I knew I wanted to
                create a digital newsletter of what I've learned this semester in Hunter College's
                AFPRL 101 course. Seeing the final product has been rewarding, but not as rewarding
                as finishing this course with a more critical-thinking mindset and open-mind. We highly
                suggest for you to research the stories of the people on this website because the most powerful
                tool we can possess is our minds.
