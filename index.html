        Born JoAnne Deborah Byron in New York, Assata Shakur is an activist and a former member of the Black Liberation Army & the Black Panthers. Her parents divorced when she was a baby. For 3 years, she grew up with her mother, her aunt Evelyn, and grandparents in Jamaica, Queens. At the age of three, Shakur moved to North Carolina with grandparents. It was here where Shakur experienced racism and internalized self-hatred in the Jim Crow segregated South. “I can remember clearly squatting in the bushes with mosquitoes biting my bare buttocks, and my grandmother handing me toilet paper, because we could not find a place with a ‘colored’ bathroom. Sometimes we were hungry, but there was no place to eat. Other times we were sleepy and there was no hotel or motel that would admit us. If I sit and add up all the ‘colored’ toilets and drinking fountains in my life and all of the back-of-the-buses or the Jim Crow railway cars or the places I couldn't go, it adds up to one great ball of anger” (Shakur Chapter 8).

        As a teenager, Shakur returns to NYC to live with her mother and stepfather. She faced microaggressions and macroaggressions which only fueled her growing passion for civil rights and Black empowerment. Shakur went to BMCC and CCNY where she became more active in her political and social activism. It was her college years that had mobilized her. “Of all the things I had wanted to be when I was a little girl, a revolutionary certainly wasn’t one of them. And now it was the only thing I wanted to do. Everything else was secondary” (Shakur Chapter 13).

        After graduating, she moved to California and joined the Black Panther Party. She returned to NYC to lead the Harlem Chapter of the Black Panther Party but had ultimately left because of differing views and instead joined the Black liberation movement. The Black Liberation Army, being a militant group, was known to actively protest against the US government using guerilla-like tactics. As a result, the group was under constant investigation and interference from government officials. This targeting led to the arrest of Shakur where she faced multiple charges including bank robbery and the murder of a police officer. During her incarceration, she faces police brutality and other challenges while also being pregnant. She did not receive access to proper medical care and was isolated from other inmates. “At first, they wouldn’t even give me milk. Since pork was served as a staple meat almost daily, I began to slowly starve. (In county jails it goes like this: one sheet, one horse blanket, a metal cup; your cell is raided if you have luxuries, like salt.) They did everything they could to thwart the care Dr. Garrett was trying to give me” (Shakur Chapter 9).

        She eventually gave birth to her daughter, Kakuya Shakur. Shakur was ultimately acquitted of the kidnapping charge but remained incarcerated. So in 1979, with the help of other members of the BLA, Shakur escaped from prison and left the country.

        Now, Shakur lives in a political asylum in Cuba, where she continues to write about her experiences.

        <h2 class="section-title">History of Criminal Justice in the U.S.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The history of criminal justice in America is deeply rooted in racial and economic inequities. 
            While the scale of the current system is historically unprecedented, its discriminatory nature is not.
        <br><br>
            From the nation's inception, the criminal justice system has been used to maintain White dominance. 
            After conquest and genocide failed to fully control Native populations, White settlers turned to criminalization, targeting their cultural practices and dispossessing them of their land and resources. 
            During slavery, Black people were regularly criminalized but often punished outside of the court system. 
            However, the association of Blackness and Brownness with inherent criminality became deeply ingrained in the nation's cultural DNA.
        <br><br>   
            After the abolition of slavery, prisons, which had previously largely not existed, began to rapidly fill with people of color. 
            This was driven by new laws specifically targeting Black people, existing laws applied more rigorously to them, and both legal and extralegal efforts by White Southerners to control Black behavior. 
            The 13th Amendment's exception for those convicted of crimes enabled the exploitation of Black labor through convict leasing and chain gangs.
        <br><br>            
            The criminal justice system continued to operate in a racially discriminatory manner in the decades leadin up to mass incarceration.
            Despite fluctuations in crime rates, people of color, particularly Black Americans, were consistently overrepresented in prisons and jails. 
            This disparity was further exacerbated by laws and policing practices that targeted Black communities in both the South and the North.
        <br><br>            
            The Civil Rights Movement and urban uprisings of the 1960s, fueled by the discriminatory treatment of people of color by law enforcement, ironically led to the rise of mass incarceration.
            White anxieties about Black activism, coupled with the association of civil rights with lawlessness, resulted in calls for more policing and harsher laws. 
            The passage of the Law Enforcement Assistance Act (LEAA) in 1965 provided unprecedented support to law enforcement, marking the beginning of the War on Crime. 
            Significantly, the War on Crime was initiated not in response to rising crime rates, but as a political reaction to Black demands for equality.
        <br><br>  
            Several factors contributed to the dramatic increase in incarceration rates in the latter half of the 20th century:
            <li>
                The War on Drugs, driven by racialized perceptions of drug use, led to a surge in drug-related arrests and imprisonment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The expansion of criminal law and the imposition of harsher sentences, including mandatory minimums, significantly increased the length of prison terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aggressive policing tactics like no-knock raids and stop-and-frisk practices disproportionately targeted Black and Brown communities, leading to higher arrest rates.
            </li>
            <li>
                The prevalence of plea bargains, often coerced due to inadequate legal representation and the threat of lengthy sentences, resulted in a high proportion of convictions without trials.
            </li>
        <br><br>
            The consequences of mass incarceration, particularly its racialized nature, have been devastating for communities of color, leading to increased poverty, family disruption, and the erosion of social fabric. 
            The concentration of formerly incarcerated individuals in specific neighborhoods has created cycles of poverty and crime.
        <br><br>
            In conclusion, the history of the American criminal justice system is characterized by a persistent pattern of racialized criminalization and punishment. 
            This system has consistently been used to control and disenfranchised communities of color, and its current state of mass incarceration is a direct consequence of this deeply ingrained inequity.

        <h2 class="section-title">About the Black Panther Party (BPP)</h2>
        <p>
            The Black Panther Party emerged in the 1960s as a response to the systemic racism and oppression faced by Black communities in the United States. 
            It was a time when many Black people felt a sense of awakening and a desire for change, moving away from the acceptance of racial inequality. 
            The Panthers were known for their community organizing, educational programs, and survival programs, as well as their willingness to arm themselves for self-defense against police brutality. 
            The party's ideology was rooted in Black pride and a desire for liberation, drawing inspiration from figures like Malcolm X. 
            They engaged in community work, such as providing free breakfast programs, and advocated for resisting racist landlords and police. 
            The Black Panther Party aimed to empower Black people and create a sense of hope and possibility for change.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="section-title">About the Black Liberation Army (BLA)</h2>
        <p>
            The Black Liberation Army (BLA) was formed as an underground, revolutionary group that included some former members of the Black Panther Party. 
            The BLA viewed themselves as soldiers in a war against the U.S. government, whom they considered to be an imperialist force.
            They engaged in armed actions, including bank expropriations to fund their activities and attempts to liberate political prisoners. 
            The BLA operated with the understanding that the system was not capable of reform and that their freedom was directly tied to the downfall of the existing power structure. 
            They were not afraid to confront the government and believed that fear was the tool that kept the government in power, and breaking that fear would weaken them.

              Hi, I’m a senior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science.
              Creating this website for my final project has been an incredibly rewarding experience. 
              Not only did I enjoy the process of building and designing it, but I also learned so much about 
              the critical topics of mass incarceration and police violence. This project allowed me to combine my 
              passion for technology with raising awareness about important social justice issues. Thank you for visiting, 
              and I hope you find this website as meaningful as I found its creation!

                Hello! I'm a Junior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science.
                Combining my passions for social justice and technology, I knew I wanted to
                create a digital newsletter of what I've learned this semester in Hunter College's
                AFPRL 101 course. Seeing the final product has been rewarding, but not as rewarding
                as finishing this course with a more critical-thinking mindset and open-mind. We highly
                suggest for you to research the stories of the people on this website because the most powerful
                tool we can possess is our minds.

                I am very passionate about using technology to make information accessible to all.
                It is for this reason that I worked with my team to create an informative web page on Assata Shakur and the history of the U.S. justice system as a whole.
                This class taught me to think of today's issues as interconnected with yesterday's struggles, and we wanted to bring this thought process into a format that anyone could pick up and learn from.
